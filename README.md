# A JavaScript Guide Featuring the 4077th MASH Division

### Imagine a world...
in which you're the head nurse to the greatest US army surgeon in television history, Lt. Hawkeye Pierce of the the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH), in the 1950's, during the Korean war.

Just a second ago you were hanging out in the mess tent, now you're sewing young soldier back up so they can be sent straight back into battle.

### THE SITUATION:
A boy, who looks to be seventeen years old–despite the eighteen-and-a-half enslitment age restriction–is bleeding out in front of you.  You need to save his life and you have to work fast.

### YOUR ROLE:
When Hawkeye asks for a surgical tool, you hand him the right one.
